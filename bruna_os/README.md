# Bruna OS

A modular Rust-based operating system for UAV swarms.

## Vision
To create a flexible and extensible OS that can support various UAV platforms and enable complex swarm behaviors through features like:
- Seamless UAV onboarding
- Advanced navigation and control
- Coordinated pattern formation
- Robust communication infrastructure

## Modules
- `kernel`: Core microkernel components.
- `hal`: Hardware Abstraction Layer for different UAV platforms.
- `drivers`: Device drivers.
- `services`: High-level OS services (onboarding, navigation, swarm management).
- `comms`: Communication protocol abstractions.
- `utils`: Shared utilities and data structures.
